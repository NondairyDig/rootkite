Documentation - keylogging, recent dev changes.


Finished docs:
  device_handler.h
  execve_blocker.h
  files_hacks.h
  command_kite.h

Can Add/Improve:
  General:
    consider workqueues and mutex usage

  device_handler:
    create some auth mechanism for accessing the  device. like having a passphtase in a certain file or just accessing with a certain user.
    can switch all conditions with data structure
    can add mmap foperation for kernel memory dump
  
  execve_blocker:
    change to another executable to mess with the victim
  
  files_hacks:
    can block file access by filtering in openat
    for more complex file filtering/hiding/masking can be used to filter by file descriptors in statx

  command_kite:
    can also spawn multiple processes for multiple workers for added complexity.

  kite_hook:
    can keep the hooks instead of having them in an array to have O(1) instead of O(n)
