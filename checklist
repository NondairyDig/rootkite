Can Add/Improve:
  General:
    consider workqueues and mutex usage
    add ftrace hiding, filter out traces from tracefs

  device_handler:
    create some auth mechanism for accessing the  device. like having a passphtase in a certain file or just accessing with a certain user.
    can switch all conditions with data structure
    can add mmap foperation for kernel memory dump
  
  execve_blocker:
    change to another executable to mess with the victim
  
  files_hacks:
    can block file access by filtering in openat
    for more complex file filtering/hiding/masking can be used to filter by file descriptors in statx

  command_kite:
    maybe switch to sh shell, which almost always present in os
    can also spawn multiple processes for multiple workers for added complexity.

  kite_hook:
    can keep the hooks instead of having them in an array to have O(1) instead of O(n)
  
  keylogging:
    can make user "miss" by counting and notifying NOTIFY_STOP every couple of times or just replacing with another keypress

  kill_kite:
    hide chardev
  
  kite_init:
    differentiate versions on init
  
  netfilter_kite:
    CAN ADD SOURCE/DEST ADDRESS FILTER
    Protocol Filter
    ping filter
    can bypass port scanning by sending back with icmp_send port unreachable
